Equations & Symbol Table
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is where possibilities get fun!
The Value field in Loot Affixes allows for equations.
There are also dynamic keywords that can be used to reference back to current player numbers.

Some basic uses for equations are when using potions.
A healing potion will typically heal for "hp*1.0" which means 100% of your max hp.

You may also create conditional situations such as: 

"If health is below 25%, gain 50% physical damage"
This would use the affix: MULT_ALL_TYPE_ATK
and the Value "xhp < 0.25*hp ? 0.50 : 0"

Here is a list of keywords:

lvl = level							xhp = current hp (x marks the spot)
str = strength						hp = max hp (ignores wounds)
end = endurance						xmp = current mp (focus)
dex = dexterity						mp = max mp
will = willpower					xsp = current stamina
mag = magic							sp = max stamina (ignores fatigue)
wis = wisdom						fat = fatigue (focus spent or lost is fatigue)
scalem = magic scaling				wds = wounds (max hp lost)
scalew = weapon scaling				cpt = corruption (caused by Blood Vial potion/other)
eqp = equipment %

Weapon Checks
You can also check to see if the player has certain weapons equipped!
To create fist only bonuses 
you can use the affix: MULT_MELEE_ATK_DAM
with the Value "fists ? 0.5 : 0"

fists								sword
berserk = axes and maces			bow 
great = great weapons				staff
shield								wand
spear = spear, poleaxe, halberd		whip = whip and chainwhip
xbow = crossbow						whipsword = whipsword only
pistol = flintlock
