Monsters

Controls which animations monsters use, their titles and descriptions, base health, etc.
Also contains drop table information. Item drop stats are related to player Item Drop stat, starting at about half what's listed here.

All sorts of stuff can be changed here, but you may experience unpredictable stuff including crashes if playing with anims.
