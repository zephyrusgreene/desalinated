Customizing Textures

This doc file describes keywords and extra notes for texturelist.sjson

Custom textures are not produced for this mod directly. You may create your own .png and transform them to .xnb,
or you may find textures on nexusmods.com and elsewhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add Custom Texture

Custom textures can be used for weapons, armors, and shields.
To add textures, place them in the folder "Content\gfx\custom\"

Adding weapon, armors, and shield textures will increase RAM usage very mildly.
Since these are added to memory at bootup, existing weapons, armors, and shields will not be removed or replaced.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup

To use custom textures add the file name to texturelist.sjson, excluding the extension (.xnb).
Filename would appear as "serrated_sword"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Notes

You may also use the spritesheets for consumables.xnb and items.xnb (UI-Items), but these maintain original ID references.
This is a file swap at bootup. The originals are replaced entirely with whatever file you use.

Id's are not in a perfect grid and may take some trial and error to find unused id's.

You use these the same way as other custom textures.
Any file listed with the spriteReference = "consumables" or "items" will replace the original texture sheet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subfolders 

You may add subfolders to the custom folder.
Desalinated will require subfolder paths when referenced in weapons.sjson, armors.sjson, and shields.sjson.
As well as texturelist.

The custom folder does not need a reference, it is prepended automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last Step

The texturelist file MUST also contain a filename and sprite sheet reference for the game to read the texture in.
The file extension isn't necessary.

[
	{
		filename = "serrated_sword",
		spriteReference = "sword_katana"
	},
	{
		filename = "demo/rusty_sword",
		spriteReference = "sword_katana"
	}
]
