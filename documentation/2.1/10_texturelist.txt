Salt and Sanctuary: Desalinated 2.1.3+

Texture List
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduced in 2.1.3 this allows the user to ADD new textures to the game, as long as they follow the sprite sheets of prior textures.

You only need to add the filename of the new xnb texture file. Xnb is a default format for use in XNA/Monogame which is used in S&S.
There are already a few custom XNB textures available on NexusMods. Textures in the list are loaded on boot but must be referenced on loot or 
monsters to be applied.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FileName 		| The file name to look for. | Do not include the ".xnb" extension
CellReference 	| The original file name for which the sprite-rectangles should follow. 
Type 			| An internal type value | Recommended to just mimic whatever the original texture was.
