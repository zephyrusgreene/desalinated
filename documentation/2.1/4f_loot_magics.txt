------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subtypes (Magics use them too)

Extra subtypes for safety checks and internal structures. Used for magics as well.

MissileName

There is a new data file missiles.sjson. This links a missile from there to the activated magic/consumable.
This is used for every attacking spell and thrown item. Base damage for missiles are locked to the missile.
Scaling comes from the magic or consumable used however.
