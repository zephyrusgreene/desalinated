Salt and Sanctuary: Desalinated 2.1.0+
by Zephyr Greene

Overview

This is merely an overview and specifics can be found in the documentation folder (TBD).
I will go as deep as I can on each subject within its own file.

Bug Fixes

1.  Ring of Meditation -> Prayers are now properly discounted.
2.  Burning Sky Ring -> Spells and Incantations are now properly discounted.
3.  GUI Focus -> Focus costs now displayed as true costs instead of base costs.
4.  Elemental -> Elemental attack bonuses now use base damage instead of base physical damage.
5.  Pale Charm -> Attack Reach now affects Spear class weapons and various Spin attack_anims.
6.  Offhand Magic -> Incantations and Prayers now use the highest base value between offhand and mainhand, instead of defaulting to offhand.
7.  GUI Damage -> Damage numbers now include Buffs and Sanctuary bonuses. Fist damage is also now visible.
8.  GUI Damage -> Now also has Attack and Attack2 for Ammo1 vs Ammo2 or mainhand vs offhand.
9.  Dark Swarm -> Updated to use loot data for focus cost like other magicks.
10. Gunblade -> This should never eat your charms or bug out anymore. Certain attack combos still ignore ammo_cost.
11. Other -> Bugs may have been fixed that weren't documented.

-1. Bug introduced -> This mod breaks the internal Steamworks Leaderboard functionality. This means jurney bottles, hanged players, 
						roaming players, and boss candles are disabled/naked. Co-op play is unaffected.

New Files (Json/Sjson)

The previous version of Desalinated required you to unpack and repack binary data into XML. This has been removed.
Now all major data files exist in Simplified Json files (.sjson) and are loaded into the game automagically, so that you don't have to manually pack/unpack like before.
More files are available to edit and some files have been split apart so that you only have to dig through relevant data.
These files can be customized on a per-Mod basis and fully allow new items to be created.
Spells and Throwing weapons now use a Missile definition, so extra versions of these should also be possible.
The new Missiles file allows modders to edit projectile damage and base trajectory. (i.e. Lob vs Throw)
The new HitsTable file allows for modifying stamina costs and damage ratios of Melee/Mainhand weapons.
SkillTree and CharClass files allow you to customize a full fledged mod or just a given run to try out!

Loot Affixes aka Specials

A significant portion of this mod is merely to give dynamic control to the modder through item properties. I called these Affixes.
Each equipment type: Mainhand, Offhand, Shield, Helm, Chest, Boots, Pants, Gloves, Rings, Charms; can have an unbounded number of Affixes on them.
Consumables and Magicks that apply to the player also use their own set of Affixes, which trigger buffs such as Enchants, Defenses, etc.
Each affix has 4 properties. The primary properties are Affix Name and Value which control most affixes. 
There are two additional properties for specialized Affixes such as Duration for timing Buffs and Property for internal triggers.
The Affix Value property allows for math and a single if-else ternary operator.
Using the SkillTree file, modders can add Affixes to SkillNodes to craft extremely unique experiences.

Other

Fists now have their own weapon data now!
Shields now have Parry values!
Blocking with a Weapon or Fists now uses an Affix to reference a shield item for its defense and parry values. 
Complete overhaul of the damage system. This has pros and cons. It will be different and may require fine tuning for balance.
GameRules and Formulas now allow you to modify global functionalities like Poison application or duration.
Formulas use the same player data, math, and functionalities as Affixes.
The game can now be unbounded by FPS (I tested at 300 ish), but this may have unknown/unseen side effects.

Oh and also cosmetic armor slots.
