MissileName

There is a new data file missiles.sjson. This links a missile from there to the activated magic/consumable.
This is used for every attacking spell and thrown item. Base damage for missiles are locked to the missile.
Scaling comes from the magic or consumable used however.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AmmoDamage 
Ammo does not use MissileName and calculates as a bonus to base Ranged damage. 
This means the Weapon scaling applies to the ammo. Changing final damage a bit.
