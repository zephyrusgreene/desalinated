CharFocusPool_Formula | How your max focus (mana) is calculated 

CharStaminaPool_Formula | How your max Stamina is calculated

CharEquipPool_Formula | How your max Equipment (load or weight) value is calculated. 

SoftCapStat_Formula | How the softcap for stats is calculated | value a is the value of the stat being checked

SofterCapStat_Formula | How the softer softcap for stats is calculated | Used for non-damaging stats | value a is the stat being checked 

CharResistAll_Formula | How much defense you get for free per level | default is 1.125 per level | Original game only showed 0.125 in UI

StaminaRegen_Formula | How much stamina you regenerate per second | Normal stamina regen pauses after certain actions

DropRate_Formula | How item drop rate is calculated | Drops are rolled individually true or false | Value A is monster listed drop chance
							| Value B is player listed Item Find stat
							
MagicCost_Formula | How Spells calculate their cost | Default is more expensive with higher equip load | Val A is base mana cost

IncantCost_Formula | How Incantations calculate their cost | Default is more expensive with higher equip load but slightly different from spells 
							| Val A is base mana cost

PrayerCost_Formula | How Prayers calculate their cost | Default is LESS expensive with higher equip load | Val A is base mana cost

WeaponSpellPower_Formula | How magic damage is calculated | Value A is Spell Damage scaled with stats 
							| Value B is Weapon Spell Power scaled with stats (shown as weapon spell damage in inventory)

ChargeAtkDam_Formula | The ratio of time for how your melee charge attack calculates. | Value A is Percent of charge time % complete 
					 | Value B is the charge attack bonus damage ratio | E.g. (vala * valb) is linear allowing the player to release early
					 | while (vala * vala * valb) is squared time, discouraging partial charge attacks
					 | Final note on this, this also increases stamina cost by the same ratio

ChargeAtkAddStagger_Formula | The ratio of how much bonus stagger the charge attack gains | Value A is charge time % again
						    | This is additive not multiplicative
