Stats Scaling and other Decisions

With the damage rewrite and various musings on what should or should not be built in what ways, I bring you what is and will be.

The original damage had some minor issues in what I'd call player traps. Some weapons had extremely low scaling in one stat and medium or 
high scaling in another. The best case scenario often meant to actually ignore the weaker stat, but it stared at you in every menu begging 
you to get more dexterity even though it only had an E scaling. The Branding Iron was one of the biggest offenders. What started as a 50/50
split between physical and fire damages would shift via stat scaling to 20/80 or so. This is no longer possible. Agree or disagree, it's changed.

Damage scaling on stats is now even across all stats. A weapon with Magic-stat scaling will scale fire, holy, arcane, poison, strike and slash,
instead of the previous stat scalings, which used a 5th special scaling for magical and holy weapons. This means all ratios have been adjusted.
Damage ratios are intended to be similar to a nearly max ranked weapon (50 in every stat). The Branding Iron mentioned above then starts 20/80
and never shifts from that ratio from stat scaling.

Weapon Enchantments (Buffs)

Elemental bonuses such as those from buffs, charms, sacred page, and pitchfire will scale from the weapon's base damage and not the 
Physical damage only. Weapon enchantments cannot be 'glitched' to stack anymore and using a new item or buff will cancel all other 
enchantments that are currently on the player's weapon. However, it is now possible to have enchantments give multiple damage types
at once such as DBW granting a combination of Holy & Fire.

Simply put, damage primarily either adds to the base damage of the effect or adds a multiplier on top of it.

Physical Damage

Order of Calculations

0. Ammo Damage					| Additive to Base
1. Stat Scaling 				| Multiplier
2. Rank Scaling					| Multiplier
3. Buffs and Enchantments 		| Multiplier
4. Critical Effects 			| Multiplier (Optional through affixes)
5. Sanctuary Bonuses			| Multiplier (Follows the same rules as before, the bonus can be modified in Rules)
6. Defiled Debuff				| Multiplier (Defiled Flask)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Damage

Order of Calculations

1. Weapon Spell Strength 		| Used as base damage
2. Stats Scaling on Weapon		| Multiplier #1
3. Magic/Spell Base				| Used as base damage part 2
4. Scaled Magic Damage			| Multiplier on #3
5. Do Formula					| Special Stuff
5. Magic Amp Buff				| Multiplier
6. Sanctuary Bonuses			| Multiplier
7. Defiled Flask				| Multiplier

Magical damage uses its original formula where part of the damage comes from the staff or current weapon 
				and part comes from the magic used.
		
Formula = (#4 * (#2 * C + 0.5)
			Magic Scaling Constant = 0.02
			
Another note, when choosing the weapon I have now prioritized the highest Spell Strength between your mainhand and offhand. 
This means that if your mainhand has a higher Spell Strength, your damage will not be downgraded by calculating with 
your pistol or wand. The base value of Spell Strength on weapons is their previous base damage. This is how the original game 
calculated damage for magics (Spells, Incantations, and Prayers). 

In other words, while a lot has changed, damage should be very very similar.
