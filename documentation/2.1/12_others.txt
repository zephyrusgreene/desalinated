Monsters and Dialog

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not going to go into too much detail here. There are 3 final files that you should be aware of.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hits Table

The hitstable.sjson file controls various effects that were previously internally controlled. This controls many stamina costs and animation
multipliers used for combo-damages. This is only useful for Physical attacks and there are many hit animations that are superfluous in here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monsters

The monsters.sjson file controls lots of stats like damage and base life and armor of monsters. Changing the order of monsters in this file
will change spawns and is how a monster randomizer can work. All sorts of stuff can be changed here, but you may experience unpredictable stuff.
You can also change their drop tables in here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dialog

The dialog.sjson file controls the dialog-trees that NPCs use to talk to you. The primary reason to be aware of this file is that you can 
change the inventory of NPC stores.
