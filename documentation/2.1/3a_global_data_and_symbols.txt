Global Game Data & Formulas Symbol Table


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This framework allows various values to be changed not just as Affixes on items, but also on the base game.

Rules
The first file rules.sjson allows the modder to change components of formulas and base values such as how 
many Red or Blue potions you start the game with.

Formulas 
This file formulas.sjson allows you to change the equations used in the game such as how item drops work or 
how your max hp is calculated.

Values are generally in line with Vanilla version of Salt and Sanctuary 1.0.8 (Steam PC)

Symbol Table 

Formulas use a modified symbol table compared to the Affixes. Specifically it cannot use weapon checks (see affix symbol table document).


Dynamic Values
These represent values that are used internally and cannot be changed. Instead you may change how those values are used (or just not use them).
The formulas file will have descriptions for what these dynamic values represent on a per formula basis.

vala = Value A
valb = Value B

Stats

lvl = level							xhp = current hp (x marks the spot)
str = strength						hp = max hp (ignores wounds)
end = endurance						xmp = current mp (focus)
dex = dexterity						mp = max mp
will = willpower					xsp = current stamina
mag = magic							sp = max stamina (ignores fatigue)
wis = wisdom						fat = fatigue (focus spent or lost is fatigue)
scalem = magic scaling				wds = wounds (max hp lost)
scalew = weapon scaling				cpt = corruption (caused by Blood Vial potion/other)
